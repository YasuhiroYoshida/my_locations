# my_locations

MyLocations - another iOS app originally created by Matthijs Hollemans.

This is a location app created with CoreLocation, CoreData, and MapKit.

This app will let you get and store your current geographic coordinate as well as address with a touch of a button. Together with the data, you can also add details of the location including a photo.

Using QuartzCore and AudioToolboxUIKit, a bit of animation and sound was added to enhance the functionality.
